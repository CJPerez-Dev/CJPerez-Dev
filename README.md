# Hello, my name is **Chase Perez**

I graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science complemented by a minor in Mathematics. Over the past three years, I have worked on numerous projects in collaboration with other students and professors as part of both in-person and remote teams. This has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development and a thorough understanding of the software development life cycle. I also have a strong aptitude for examining complex problems, breaking them down into manageable components, and creating effective solutions.

When I'm away from my computer, I spend my time enjoying the outdoors and staying active. You'll often find me hiking mountain trails, going for runs, or lifting weights in the gym. I also enjoy getting outside for some more relaxation with activities like camping. I always try to find room for a bit of gaming to unwind and indulge in some digital adventures as well.

If you would like to reach out to me the best way is through my LinkedIn which you can find on my GitHub profile.

Thank you for taking the time to read my bio and I look forward to meeting you!
